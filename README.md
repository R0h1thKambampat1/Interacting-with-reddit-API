# Interacting-with-reddit-API
### This project acts as an introduction to interacting with reddit using python. In order to access reddit using the praw library the user must already have a reddit account. The user can obtain an id and a secret key to access the reddit api by visiting https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
### Using my id and my secret key which I saved in a file called credentials which I didn't upload for obvious reasons, I was able to access reddit via python.
### A list of subreddits of interest is available in subreddits.json. 
### I obtained the hot posts, top posts in the subreddits and saved them in the files titled hot_10_posts.json and top_10_posts.json respectively.
### Once obtaining data from reddit has been implemented, there is a small segment of code which deals with posting on reddit using python.
### The subreddit titled testingground4bots is used to test posting to a subreddit and the test I performed can be seen in the file test.png
